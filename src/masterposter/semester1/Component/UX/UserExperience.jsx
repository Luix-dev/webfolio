                                    Using UX methods to create a system or a design helps structure the process. 
                                    But there are a lot of different methods and approaches. As a designer I want to know when to use which method. 
                                    Choosing the right method is essential for this process. There is no method that does it all, so how can I pick the right one?

                            <p>Defining empathy is not as easy as it sounds. There are various definitions, but the following definition seams very fitting to me:</p>
                            <p>
                            <li>
                                The ability to identify with or understand the perspective, experiences, 
                                or motivations of another individual and to comprehend and share another 
                                individual's emotional state.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                The projection of one's own feelings or thoughts onto something 
                                else, such as an object in a work of art or a character in a novel or film.
                            </li>

                            <p>
                                In order to be empathetic with our users we not only have to understand the users but 
                                also help others to understand them. To achieve this, I prefer to use an empathy map. 
                                The empathy map includes the following points:
                                <br />
                                Says &rarr; Things the user says out loud during an interview.
                                <br />
                                Thinks &rarr; Thoughts the user has during the experience. It also helps when you can see the user and his reactions to certain circumstances.
                                <br />
                                Does &rarr; Actions that the user takes.
                                <br />
                                Feels &rarr; Reflects the emotional state of the user. Use adjectives!
                            </p>

                            Creating a transformative product experience requires the designer to 
                            know the user on a very deep and whole plane. The goal is to know the user, 
                            his everyday life and the working routine to design something that is perfectly 
                            suited for his needs. The key point of this process is the context.
                            Contextual design involves different methods to gain empathy for the user. 
                            The cool project by incontext design describes two core elements.

                                    etc should be very easy and hassle-free.

                                    The product shouldn't require real learning to use its basic functions. 
                                    Known interaction paradigms and natural interactions should be used. 
                                    If it gets complex, then it should be because the user choses to.
